# Bank of Flatiron

Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial
data! Use the below gif as an example of how the app should function.

## Instructions

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

## Setup
1. Run `npm install` in your terminal.
2. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `8001`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `8000`.

Make sure to open
[http://localhost:8001/transactions](http://localhost:8001/transactions) in the
browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!

The app uses Bootsrap for styling. If you see any
unfamiliar classNames on some components, don't sweat! That's coming from
Semantic UI and you shouldn't need to touch it.

If you are unfamiliar with HTML tables, take a look at the
[docs with an example here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp)

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See a table of the transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new
  transaction to the table **as well as post the new transaction to the backend
  API for persistence**.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a
  description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions
  table.
